    <h2 id="Experience">My experience as a programming student</h2>
    <p class="reflection">Learning to code has been extremely fun for the past few years. It gave me a new perspective on everything I like. Websites, video games, apps, and so many more important things use code to make it work. It feels good to be a part of making such a thing, even if it is a text game made in an hour on C++. Through coding, I think I've become a better problem solver because if an error made a game or program unusable, you have to figure out what you did wrong and fix it. I've been able to express my creativity very much through programming, because I can make my vision come to life on a screen like when I made Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson a rock button in a Rock Paper Scissors game using Actionscript. I think everyone should take a chance to learn to code not only because of the importance in this day and age, but because it's so fun.</p>
    <h2 id="ForTheFuture">My future as a programmer</h2>
    <p class="reflection">Overall I just want to learn more with the languages I already know and learn more languages like Python. Other than that, and getting into university programming of course, I don't really know. I just want to expand my knowledge of programming and technology in general. I know I've only barely scratched the surface of object oriented programming and I find that to be very interesting how it makes long programs so much shorter and simpler. Then you get to the really long object oriented programs and I can't imagine what it would be like if all the values were hard coded. Something I would really like to be is a video game developer. I'm a gamer if it's not already obvious and I was always fascinated by all the aspects. And to be a part of that process would be really cool for me.
